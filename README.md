# CRUD_PURE_NODEJS

This is a simple CRUD I created to learn node js.

this API uses the same names as the express uses

1° I defined all endpoints following REST naming standards ('/users' for example). 
  When is necessary access a specific resource, delete or altereted, i passed the ID param in URL
  
2° in the index file, first i do parse of URL for extract the queryParams and transform queryString to object
